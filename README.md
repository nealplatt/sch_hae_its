## Abstract

The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rDNA and cox1 mitochondrial markers are widely used to differentiate *Schistosoma haematobium* from its livestock counterparts, *S. bovis* and *S. curassoni*. Parasites with heterozygous ITS or discordant mitochondrial DNA (mitoDNA) and ITS markers are often classified as hybrids, while parasites with homozygous livestock ITS markers are typically assumed to be spillover infections. We evaluated the predictive power of this approach by genotyping ITS and mtDNA from 132 *S. haematobium* and 37 *S. bovis* collected from 14 locations across Nigeria. These parasites were also genome sequenced to empirically determine levels of introgression in the nuclear genome. Two-marker genotyping with mtDNA and ITS suggested extensive hybridization and cross-infection. Among parasites collected from humans, 20.2% were homozygous for *S. curassoni* ITS, consistent with zoonotic infections, while 10.1% carried both *S. curassoni* and *S. haematobium* ITS, consistent with early generation hybrids following common classification schemes. Additionally, 13.7% of parasites carried *S. bovis* mtDNA alongside mixed *S. curassoni* and *S. haematobium* ITS, indicating more complex ancestry. Genome sequencing revealed a very different picture. We found no evidence of recent hybridization. Instead, we observed varying levels of *S. bovis* introgression concentrated in southern Nigeria (0.00–18.41%) relative to northern Nigeria (0.00–0.99%). Collection location was the strongest predictor of nuclear introgression; mtDNA and/or ITS genotype had no significant power to predict introgression. These results demonstrate that (i) two-locus genotyping is uninformative for detecting recent hybridization or spillover events, (ii) previous data generated using this approach requires reinterpretation, and (iii) the terminology used to describe schistosome hybrids should be applied with greater nuance. These findings highlight discrepancies between two-locus and genome-wide data and emphasize the limitations of the standard approaches for documenting hybridizing parasites.
